**Goal of the game:**

In Everdell 1 to 4 players each pick a forest creature to play. They focus to build a town consisting of critters and buildings. They progress through the seasons of the year. At the end of the game, points are awarded based on the value of critters and buildings in each players town.  The players with the highest number of points at the end of the game is declared the winner.  All the Everdell expansions currently on the market add another level of fun and enjoyment to the game without taking away from the core game.
