**Goal of the game:**

In Pandemic 1 to 4 players take on the role of members on a disease control team. Everyone works together to develop cures and prevent disease outbreaks across the world map. There are 4 deadly diseases (Blue, Yellow, Black, and Red) that threaten humanity. This is another game where the expansions make the game even more fun and enjoyable. Each of the expansions add a new mechanic to the game or add a way to upgrade one of the core mechanics. They all make the game challenging in a new and exciting way.
