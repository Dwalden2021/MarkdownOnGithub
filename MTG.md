**Goal of the game**

Personally, this is my favorite game to play. I enjoy the versatility and variety of options to choose from. MTG has been out since the 90's so there are thousands of cards to choose from. There are many ways to play. The size of the deck, deck construction, the number of duplicate cards allowed in the deck, and the number of players are all changeable. The most common ways that we play is 2 - 5 players with a 100 card decks with no duplicate cards allowed with in the 100-card deck. We also like to play with 60 cards decks where 4 copies of the same card are allowed with the deck. The variety and continued release of new cards ensures that we are always happy to sit down and play a few rounds together.
